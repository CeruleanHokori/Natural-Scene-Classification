Intel Image Classification (subset) 

In this particular task I used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
The result was a fine-tuned VGG19 model with over 97% accuracy over 3 classes (Buildings, Forest and Sea)
The same structure can be used to generate a high-accuracy model for any subset of the classes present in this dataset (We just have to load the corresponding images)
